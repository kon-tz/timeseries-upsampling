# Improving Time Series Upsampling using ML Models
This repository contains the code written for my thesis research project with the title "Development of Machine Learning Μodel for the resampling of timeseries for energy and building domain".
This section from the Abstract sumarized the work perfectly:
This thesis investigates a machine learning based approach to the upsampling of energy
consumption time series. Multiple neural network architectures were implemented and
evaluated, including Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) models with Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) cells, several convolutional neural network (CNN) variants, and an
autoencoder based on the model U-Net.
The models were trained and evaluated using real-world building energy consumption data.
The method was further tested on a second, independent dataset to assess its performance on
unseen data. The final results demonstrate that deep learning models can adequately enhance
the upsampling accuracy of conventional numerical techniques. The best performance was
achieved by the CNN models, which generated realistic time series even at high upsampling
factors.
